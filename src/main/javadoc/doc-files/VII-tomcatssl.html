            Notes:
            <br>
              Tomcat can use two different implementations of SSL:
            <br>
              the JSSE implementation provided as part of the Java runtime (since 1.4)
            <br>
              the APR implementation, which uses the OpenSSL engine by default.
            <br><br>
              The exact configuration details depend on which implementation is being used. The implementation used by Tomcat is chosen automatically unless it is overriden as described below. If the installation uses APR - i.e. you have installed the Tomcat native library - then it will use the APR SSL implementation, otherwise it will use the Java JSSE implementation.
            <br>
              To avoid auto configuration you can define which implementation to use by specifying a classname in the protocol attribute of the Connector.
            <br>
              To define a Java (JSSE) connector, regardless of whether the APR library is loaded or not do:
